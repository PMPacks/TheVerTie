    # Commands to be executed when a player claims their vote.
    # They should not include the first "/" and they should be encased in quotes.
    # It is recommended to encase the username variable in escaped quotes (\") to make sure it
    #  is sent as one argument to the command to ensure they get all of their rewards.
    # List of useable variables:
    #  {username}: The player's in game username
    #  {displayname}: The player's display/nick name
    #  {x}: The player's X coordinate
    #  {y}: The player's Y coordinate

droprewards: false
items:
    # Items to be given to a player when they claim their vote.
    # They should follow the format: "item_name:meta:amount:name:enchant_name:enchant_level".
    #  "name" can either be a custom name, or "default" to have no custom name.
    #  "item_name", "meta", "amount" & "name" must all come before any enchantments.
    #  "enchant_name:enchant_level" can be repeated as many times as you want.
    # Enchantments from PiggyCustomEnchants are also supported, use them the same as regular enchants.
    # They should also always be encased in quotes to make sure they get parsed properly.
